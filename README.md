# Bayesian Telephone: Memory Consolidation and Recall as Generative Processes

This is a code repo for Bayesian Telephone: Memory Consolidation and Recall as Generative Processes, a paper written for the **Algorithms of the Mind** course at Yale.

## Key Files

`shapes3d.ipynb` contains the code used to implement a Hopfield network and variational autoencoder to model consolidation and recall of memory using the shapes3d dataset.

`Bayesian hypothesis.ipynb` contains the code used to implement a Bayesian system that infers latent parameters associated with images from a Mitsuba 3 constructed dataset.

`true observation hypothesis.ipynb` contains the code used to implement the true observation hypothesis mentioned in the paper.
