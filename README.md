#Total Recall

Code repo for the final project for the "Algorithms of the Mind" course at Yale.

shapes3d.ipynb contains the code used to reimplement a hopfield al autoencoder for recall and imaginative memory.

Generative_Model.ipynb will soon contain the code to implement a Bayesian system that infers latent parameters associated with images from the shapes 3D dataset and implements generation of "imagination" images built by rendering Shape3D images with similar latent parameters.
