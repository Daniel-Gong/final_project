# Bayesian Telephone: Memory Consolidation and Recall as Generative Processes

Code availability for Bayesian Telephone: Memory Consolidation and Recall as Generative Processes, a paper written for the "Algorithms of the Mind" course at Yale. 

## Key Files

Julia_Notebook.ipynb contains the code used to reimplement a hopfield network and variational autoencoder for recall and imaginative memory. 


## Deprecated Files

Generative_Model.ipynb contains drafted code to implement a Bayesian system that infers latent parameters associated with images from a Mitsuba 3 constructed dataset and implements generation of reconstructed images built by rendering Mitsuba 3 images with similar latent parameters. This file also contains some code experimenting with building a probabilistic model of "forgetting" which was abandoned. Ideas from this sandbox file were used to implement parts of Julia_Notebook.ipynb and ____
