#Total Recall
Code availability for Total Recall, a paper written for the "Algorithms of the Mind" course at Yale. 

Julia_Notebook.ipynb contains the code used to reimplement a hopfield network and variational autoencoder for recall and imaginative memory. 

Generative_Model.ipynb will soon contain the code to implement a Bayesian system that infers latent parameters associated with images from the shapes 3D dataset and implements generation of "imagination" images built by rendering Shape3D images with similar latent parameters.
